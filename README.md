\# 🧠 SQL Projects Portfolio



Welcome to my \*\*SQL Projects Repository\*\* — a curated collection of projects built to demonstrate my \*\*skills in database design, data querying, analytics, and reporting\*\* using \*\*Microsoft SQL Server\*\*.



Each project represents a real-world business scenario where I’ve applied \*\*SQL concepts like Joins, Subqueries, Aggregations, Window Functions, and Reporting Queries\*\* to solve analytical problems.
